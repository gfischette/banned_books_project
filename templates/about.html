<h3>How it Works</h3>

<p>First, the public, as well as school officials, can send in challenges for specific books they believe should be banned based on their content. Then, the district holds a public meeting with district school committees where the book challenge is discussed and either agreed upon or thrown out. If it is agreed to be material that should be banned, it is sent to the school board where the final decision on whether the book will be pulled from school shelves is made.</p><br>
	
<p>While there is no specific standardization on the rules of this for all districts, there is consistency in that most of them followed similarly to the above process.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p>During my search, I found a list of books banned by each school district as of October 2023. This list covered around 40 of the districts and said the others did not have any data at that point on banned books. I then researched all the other districts and found that about 10-15 of them had reported banned books in recent months, so I currently have around 50-55 districts that have listed the books they banned, as well as information on what titles they banned. </p>
